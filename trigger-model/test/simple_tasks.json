The order of the Superior Court is VACATED, and the matter is REMANDED to the Superior Court for consideration of whether the trial court improperly permitted newly-discovered evidence regarding the alleged contents of a telephone conversation between Petitioner and his wife to be introduced at trial over Petitioner\u2019s objection, as the Superior Court erroneously found the issue to be waived because Petitioner did not also additionally request a mistrial.
